# WWF-App

To run and edit this project, you need to have node installed on your computer. It was developed using Node v-16.15.1 but the latest version should work.

Once you have node installed, navigate to the root directory and run "**npm i**" to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

You'll need to have Android Studio/ XCode and the relevant emulator installed to test this app
